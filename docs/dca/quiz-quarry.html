</ul>
<p>Quorum is crucial in a Docker swarm cluster to maintain consistency. It ensures that there are enough manager nodes in agreement to prevent network partitions and guarantee that operations are consistent across the cluster. If a swarm loses the majority of its manager nodes, the remaining nodes will go into a locked state to preserve data consistency.</p>

<p>If a manager node is believed to be compromised, the first recommended step is to demote it. This ensures that it no longer has control over the swarm while preserving the integrity and functionality of the swarm. After demotion, further actions like isolating and analyzing the node can be taken.</p>

<p>Storing sensitive information in a container's writable layer is not recommended because it can increase the size of the container and is less efficient. Instead, it's better to use volumes or tmpfs mounts to manage such data. Volumes are the preferred way to persist data in Docker, and tmpfs mounts are best for data that shouldn't persist.</p>

<p>A. Use the 'docker container save' command to save container data.</p>
<p>B. Directly copy data from the container's filesystem using the host OS tools.</p>
<p  class="correct" >C. Commit the container to an image using 'docker container commit' and then push the image to Docker Hub or save it to a local tar file.</p>
<p>D. Use the 'docker container export' command to export container data to an external storage.</p>

<p>To backup data from a Docker container, you can commit the container to an image using the 'docker container commit' command. This stores the container filesystem changes and some of the container's configuration. Once committed, you can either push the image to Docker Hub using 'docker push' or save it to a local tar file using 'docker image save'. Note that changes in volumes attached to the container are not included in the image and must be backed up separately.</p>

<li>Which of the following best describes the lifecycle of a Docker volume?</li>
</ol>
<p>A. Volumes are automatically deleted when the container using them is stopped.</p>
<p>B. Volumes can only be created when starting a container and are deleted when the container is removed.</p>
<p  class="correct" >C. Volumes are created using the Docker CLI or when starting a container with a not-yet-created volume, and they persist beyond the lifecycle of a container.</p>
<p>D. Volumes are temporary storage mechanisms and their data is cleared every time the Docker daemon restarts.</p>

</ul>
<p>Docker volumes are designed to persist data beyond the lifecycle of a container. They can be created using the Docker CLI with commands like 'docker volume create' or automatically when starting a container that specifies a volume that doesn't yet exist. Unlike the container's writable layer, data in the volume doesn't increase the size of the container and exists outside the lifecycle of the container.</p>

</ul>
<p>For write-intensive applications, it's recommended not to store the data in the container. Instead, Docker volumes should be used. They are independent of the running container and are designed to be efficient for I/O. Volumes can also be shared among containers and do not increase the size of the container's writable layer.</p>
