 The mnt namespace is not disabled by default and does not need to be enabled at Docker engine runtime to be used. The mnt namespace is one of the six Linux kernel namespaces that Docker uses to isolate containers from the host system1. The mnt namespace allows a container to have its own set of mounted filesystems and root directories, which are different from the host’s2. This means that a container can access only the files and directories that are mounted inside its namespace, and not the ones that are mounted on the host or other containers. The mnt namespace is created automatically when a container is started, and it is destroyed when the container stops3.

n: = Using the DTR web UI to make all tags in the repository immutable is not a good way to prevent an image, such as ‘nginx:latest’, from being overwritten by another user with push access to the repository. This is because making all tags immutable would prevent any updates to the images in the repository, which may not be desirable for some use cases. For example, if a user wants to push a new version of ‘nginx:latest’ with a security patch, they would not be able to do so if the tag is immutable. A better way to prevent an image from being overwritten by another user is to use the DTR web UI to create a promotion policy that restricts who can push to a specific tag or repository1. Alternatively, the user can also use the DTR API to create a webhook that triggers a custom action when an image is pushed to a repository2. References:

 Label constraints can be used to schedule containers to meet the security policy requirements. Label constraints are a way to specify which nodes a service can run on based on the labels assigned to the nodes. Labels are key-value pairs that can be attached to any node in the swarm. For example, you can label nodes as development or production depending on their intended use. Then, you can use the --constraint option when creating or updating a service to filter the nodes based on their labels. For example, to run a service only on development nodes, you can use:

docker service create --constraint 'node.labels.environment == development' ...

To run a service only on production nodes, you can use:

docker service create --constraint 'node.labels.environment == production' ...

This way, you can ensure that development and production containers run on separate nodes in the swarm, as required by the security policy. References:

The user namespace is a Linux kernel namespace that is disabled by default and must be enabled at Docker engine runtime to be used. The user namespace allows the host system to map its own uid and gid to some different uid and gid for containers’ processes. This improves the security of Docker by isolating the user and group ID number spaces, so that a process’s user and group ID can be different inside and outside of a user namespace1. To enable the user namespace, the daemon must start with --userns-remap flag with a parameter that specifies base uid/gid2.

When content trust is enabled, Docker blocks any command that operates on unsigned images, such as docker service create.

<article class="bg-purple-900">
The --privileged flag lifts all the cgroup limitations for a container, as well as other security restrictions imposed by the Docker daemon1. This gives the container full access to the host’s devices, resources, and capabilities, as if it was running directly on the host2. This can be useful for certain use cases that require elevated privileges, such as running Docker-in-Docker or debugging system issues3. However, using the --privileged flag also poses a security risk, as it exposes the host to potential attacks or damages from the container4. Therefore, it is not recommended to use the --privileged flag unless absolutely necessary, and only with trusted images and containers.

The other options are not correct because they do not lift all the cgroup limitations for a container, but only affect specific aspects of the container’s resource allocation or isolation:

•The --cpu-period flag sets the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period for a container, which is the length of a CPU cycle in microseconds. This flag can be used in conjunction with the --cpu-quota flag to limit the CPU time allocated to a container. However, this flag does not affect other cgroup limitations, such as memory, disk, or network.

•The --isolation flag sets the isolation technology for a container, which is the mechanism that separates the container from the host or other containers. This flag is only available on Windows containers, and can be used to choose between process, hyperv, or process-isolated modes. However, this flag does not affect the cgroup limitations for a container, but only the level of isolation from the host or other containers.

•The --cap-drop flag drops one or more Linux capabilities for a container, which are the privileges that a process can use to perform certain actions on the system. This flag can be used to reduce the attack surface of a container by removing unnecessary or dangerous capabilities. However, this flag does not affect the cgroup limitations for a container, but only the capabilities granted to the container by the Docker daemon.

Yes, the docker port command can be used to identify the published ports for a running container. It shows the mapping between the host ports and the container’s exposed ports. The docker network inspect command can also provide information about the network settings of the container, including port mappings. However, it’s important to note that docker network inspect requires the network’s name or ID as an argument, not the container’s. Therefore, to get the network details of a specific container, you would first need to identify the network the container is connected to. These commands, when used appropriately, can help you identify the published ports for a container.

 The set of commands docker port inspect and docker container inspect will not identify the published port(s) for a container. The reason is that there is no such command as docker port inspect. The correct command to inspect the port mappings of a container is docker port1. The command docker container inspect can also show the port mappings of a container, but it will display a lot of other information as well, so it is not as concise as docker port2. To identify the published port(s) for a container, you can use either of these commands:

docker port CONTAINER will list all the port mappings of the container1.
docker port CONTAINER PRIVATE_PORT will list only the port mapping of the specified private port of the container1.
docker container inspect --format=' { {.NetworkSettings.Ports}}' CONTAINER will list only the port mappings of the container in a JSON format23.
For example, if you have a container named web that publishes port 80 to port 8080 on the host, you can use any of these commands to identify the published port:

$ docker port web

80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:8080

$ docker port web 80

0.0.0.0:8080

$ docker container inspect --format=' { {.NetworkSettings.Ports}}' web

 SELinux could be blocking the operation of setting the system time from inside a Docker container. SELinux is a security mechanism that enforces mandatory access control (MAC) policies on Linux systems. It restricts the actions that processes can perform based on their security contexts, such as user, role, type, and level. By default, SELinux prevents Docker containers from accessing or modifying the host’s system time, as this could pose a security risk or cause inconsistency. To allow Docker containers to set the system time, SELinux needs to be configured with the appropriate permissions or labels, or disabled altogether. However, this is not recommended, as it could compromise the security and stability of the system. References:

The docker swarm command is used to manage the swarm itself, not the nodes. For example, you can use docker swarm init to create a new swarm, or docker swarm join to add a node to an existing swarm2.

27. The Kubernetes yaml shown below describes a clusterIP service. Is this a correct statement about how this service routes requests? Solution: Traffic sent to the IP of this service on port 80 will be routed to port 8080 in a random pod with the label app: nginx.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1

    name: dca
spec:
    type: clusterIP
    selector:
        app: nginx
    ports:
        -port: 8080

The statement is not entirely correct. In Kubernetes, a service of type ClusterIP routes traffic sent to its IP address to the pods selected by its label selector1. However, the port to which the traffic is routed in the pod is determined by the targetPort specified in the service definition1. If targetPort is not specified, it defaults to being the same as the port field1. In the provided YAML snippet, there is no targetPort specified for port 80, so we cannot confirm that the traffic will be routed to port 8080 in the pod. Therefore, without additional information about the pod configuration, we cannot verify the provided solution statement1.

= Authentication is not a type of Linux kernel namespace that provides container isolation. Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources such that one set of processes sees one set of resources and another set of processes sees a different set of resources. Docker uses six different namespaces to isolate containers from the host and from each other: PID, USER, UTS, IPC, MNT, and NET12. Authentication is not one of them. Authentication is a process of verifying the identity of a user or a system, which is usually done by using credentials such as passwords, tokens, or certificates. Authentication does not directly affect the isolation of containers, although it can be used to control access to them. References:

 Capabilities are a Linux kernel feature that allows processes to perform some privileged operations without having the full power of the root user1. Docker uses capabilities to limit the access of containers to host resources, such as CPU or memory2. By default, Docker drops all capabilities except those needed for the container to function properly, using a whitelist approach3. This reduces the risk of a container compromising the host system or other containers. You can also add or remove capabilities to or from a container at runtime, using the --cap-add or --cap-drop options of the docker run command4. This gives you more control over the security and functionality of your containers. References:

= The conditions are sufficient for Kubernetes to dynamically provision a persistentVolume, because they include a default storageClass and a persistentVolumeClaim. A storageClass defines which provisioner should be used and what parameters should be passed to that provisioner when dynamic provisioning is invoked. A persistentVolumeClaim requests a specific size, access mode, and storageClass for the persistentVolume. If a persistentVolume that satisfies the claim exists or can be provisioned, the persistentVolumeClaim is bound to that persistentVolume. A default storageClass means that any persistentVolumeClaim that does not specify a storageClass will use the default one. Therefore, the conditions in the question are enough to enable dynamic provisioning of storage volumes on-demand. References:

= Simultaneously creating and tagging multiple images is not an advantage of multi-stage builds. Multi-stage builds are a feature that allows you to use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile, each starting a new stage of the build1. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don’t want in the final image. This helps you to optimize the size and security of your images, as well as to simplify your build process12. However, multi-stage builds do not create or tag multiple images at once. Each Dockerfile produces one final image, which is the result of the last stage in the Dockerfile1.

Docker will block the command docker container run myorg/myimage:1.0 if the image tag myorg/myimage:1.0 is unsigned and the environment variable DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 is set. The reason is that setting DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 enables Docker Content Trust (DCT), which is a feature that allows users to verify the integrity and publisher of Docker images using digital signatures1. When DCT is enabled, Docker will only pull, run, or build images that have valid signatures. If an image tag is unsigned or has an invalid signature, Docker will reject the operation and display an error message2. Therefore, to run an unsigned image with DCT enabled, you need to either disable DCT by setting DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=0 or use the --disable-content-trust flag, or sign the image tag with a valid key3.

The daemon.json file is used to configure various aspects of the Docker engine, such as logging, storage, networking, and security1. To use a registry without a trusted TLS certificate, you need to either add the certificate to the trusted root certificates of the system, or configure the Docker engine to allow insecure registries2. To add the certificate to the trusted root certificates, you need to copy the certificate file to the /etc/docker/certs.d// directory on every Docker host2. To configure the Docker engine to allow insecure registries, you need to add the registry hostname or IP address to the “insecure-registries” array in the daemon.json file3. For example:

{ “insecure-registries” : [“myregistry.example.com:5000”] }

Note that using insecure registries is not recommended, as it exposes you to potential man-in-the-middle attacks and data corruption3. You should always use a registry with a trusted TLS certificate, or use Docker Content Trust to sign and verify your images4. References:
